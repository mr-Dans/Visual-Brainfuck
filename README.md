# Visual Brainfuck

**Visual Brainfuck** is a simple visual interpreter for the Brainfuck programming language, built with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).  
It allows you to run and step through Brainfuck code while watching memory cells update in real time, making it easier to learn, debug, and experiment with Brainfuck.

## ✨ Features

- 🖥 **Code Editor** – Write and edit Brainfuck code directly.  
- ▶ **Run** – Executes the code with a configurable delay (0.01s to 1s) using a slider.  
- ⏭ **Step** – Runs the program one instruction at a time, perfect for debugging.  
- 🧹 **Clear** – Resets everything: code, output, and memory cells.  
- 📊 **Memory Visualization** – See the memory cells change as the program executes.  
- 📤 **Live Output** – Displays the program’s output in real time.
